# family-site

This repository is the code base for a website for the Boatwright family.  The code base is built in node.js and uses the reactJS library to build it's user interfaces. The website it self will be containerized in docker and kept to microservice scale.  There will be other microservices connected to the main application through APIs that handle things like storage and retreival of artifacts (read: photographs, documents, or videos).

Ideas that would be fun to work with:
AI/Machine Learning to tag and index family photos and videos.  
Use of Search Engine optimization so a search will pull all photos or videos when searching a family member.  
Interactive Family Tree where clicking on a family member would provide pictures or videos tagged with that person.

This will be a fun experiment to see how nano I can make this thing so that I can take utilize the self-healing & auto scaling features of microservice architecture, while still utilizing advanced features of the cloud like AI and machine learning.  All the while saving hosting fees by destroying un-used containers when they are no longer needed.

Ultimately, it will be a place where a family can share memories with each other.  Use the truly great features of the cloud, without having to worry that a Facebook-type company will sell our metadata to who ever will pay money for it.
